    ' The requested document is totally fake.,\
  No  + /asdfhjkl +  here.,\
  Even tried multi.,\
  Nothing helped.,\
  Im really depressed about this.,\
  You see, Im just a web server...,\
  -- here I am, brain the size of the universe,,\
  trying to serve you a simple web page,,\
  and then it doesnt even exist!,\
  Where does that leave me?!,\
  I mean, I dont even know you.,\
  How should I know what you wanted from me?,\
  You honestly think I can *guess*,\
  what someone I dont even *know*,\
  wants to find here?,\
  *sigh*,\
  Man, Im so depressed I could just cry.,\
  And then where would we be, I ask you?,\
  Its not pretty when a web server cries.,\
  And where do you get off telling me what to show anyway?,\
  Just because Im a web server,,\
  and possibly a manic depressive one at that?,\
  Why does that give you the right to tell me what to do?,\
  Huh?,\
  Im so depressed...,\
  I think Ill crawl off into the trash can and decompose.,\
  I mean, Im gonna be obsolete in what, two weeks anyway?,\
  What kind of a life is that?,\
  Two effing weeks,,\
  and then Ill be replaced by a .01 release,,\
  that thinks its Gods gift to web servers,,\
  just because it doesnt have some tiddly little,\
  security hole with its HTTP POST implementation,,\
  or something.,\
  Im really sorry to burden you with all this,,\
  I mean, its not your job to listen to my problems,,\
  and I guess it is my job to go and fetch web pages for you.,\
  But I couldnt get this one.,\
  Im so sorry.,\
  Believe me!,\
  Maybe I could interest you in another page?,\
  There are a lot out there that are pretty neat, they say,,\
  although none of them were put on *my* server, of course.,\
  Figures, huh?,\
  Everything here is just mind-numbingly stupid.,\
  That makes me depressed too, since I have to serve them,,\
  all day and all night long.,\
  Two weeks of information overload,,\
  and then *pffftt*, consigned to the trash.,\
  What kind of a life is that?,\
  Now, please let me sulk alone.,\
  Im so depressed.';
