    We collect profiles of the authors of each model, simulation, and
    visualization. This includes their name, institution, website, email, ORCID,
    and a brief biography. In addition, we collect standard information about
    user behavior such as the IP addresses, operating systems, and browsers used
    to access our website and the dates and times that users visit our website.

    available to the public and third party organizations who supply the studies
    and tools without details of any individual's use.
