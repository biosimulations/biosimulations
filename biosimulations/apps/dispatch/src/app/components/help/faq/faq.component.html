      <biosimulations-q-a heading="How does runBioSimulations store a list of my simulations?">
        The list of simulations that you have submitted is only stored in your local browser. The runBioSimulations server does not maintain user accounts. Unless you optionally provided your email address, the runBioSimulations server has no record of which simulations you requested. As a result, if you clear your browser's cache, you will lose the list of your simulations, and it will not be possible to re-create this list.
      </biosimulations-q-a>

      <biosimulations-q-a heading="How long does runBioSimulations store simulations?">
        Simulation results are stored for 6 months?
      </biosimulations-q-a>

      <biosimulations-q-a heading="How can I share the results of a simulation with a colleague?">
        To share results with a colleague, simply send your colleague the unique URL for the simulation.
      </biosimulations-q-a>

      <biosimulations-q-a heading="How long does runBioSimulations store simulations?">
        runBioSimulations stores simulations and their results for six months.

      <biosimulations-q-a heading="How can I execute the same simulators that runBioSimulations uses on my own machine?">
        runBioSimulations uses the BioSimulators collection of containerized simulation software tools. These containers make it easy to execute simulations by all providing the same command-line interface. The containers are easy to install and run on your own machine. The containers can be used on top of any operating system. Please see  <a href="https://biosimulators.org" target="_blank">https://biosimulators.org</a> for more information about how to install and run these containers.
