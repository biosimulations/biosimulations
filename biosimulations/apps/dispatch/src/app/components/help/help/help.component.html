      <p>
        runBioSimulations requires modeling projects (one or more simulations of one or more models) to be described by an OMEX file and packaged into a COMBINE archive. Please follow these steps to create OMEX and COMBINE files. Alternatively, COMBINE/OMEX files which describe modeling projects can be obtained from the BioSimulations repository of modeling projects <a href="https://biosimulations.org" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a>.

          <b>Create a directory for the modeling project.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Create one or more models:</b>
          Create files which describe the models that you would like to simulate and save these files to the directory for the modeling project. For example, the BioNetGen Language <a href="https://bionetgen.org" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a> (BNGL) and Systems Biology Markup Language <a href="http://sbml.org" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a> (SBML) formats can be used to represent models of biochemical networks. More information about BNGL and SBML is available from their websites. Alternatively, models can be obtained from BioModels <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a>, BioSimulations <a href="https://biosimulations.org" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a>, and other model repositories.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Create or more simulations:</b>
          Create a Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language <a href="https://sed-ml.org" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a> (SED-ML) file which describes the simulations that you would like to execute and the simulation results that you would like to record. Currently, all of the simulation tools support a subset of SED-ML including one step and timecourse simulations (<code>sedml:OneStep</code> and <code>sedml:UniformTimeCourse</code>), individual simulation tasks (<code>sedml:Task</code>), data generators for time and individual variables (<code>sedml:DataGenerator</code>), and report outputs (<code>sedml:Report</code>). Some of the simulation tools support the full SED-ML specification including steady-state simulations (<code>sedml:SteadyState</code>), repeated tasks (<code>sedml:RepeatedTask</code>), data generators for mathematical expressions (<code>sedml:DataGenerator</code>), and plot outputs (<code>sedml:Plot2d</code> and <code>sedml:Plot3d</code>). Save these files to the directory for the modeling project. More information about SED-ML is available from the SED-ML website. Alternatively, simulations can be obtained from the BioSimulations repository of modeling projects <a href="https://biosimulations.org" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a>.

          <b>Create an OMEX file which describes your model and simulation files and package them into a COMBINE archive file:</b>
          OMEX is a format for describing a collection of modeling files, and a COMBINE archive is a zip file which contains an OMEX file and all of the other files which comprise the modeling project. Several example COMBINE archives are available in the BioSimulators test suite <a href="https://github.com/biosimulators/Biosimulators_test_suite" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a>. More information about the OMEX and COMBINE formats is available at the COMBINE website <a href="https://combinearchive.org/" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a>. The COMBINE website lists several software tools for creating COMBINE archives including COMBINE Archive <a href="https://combinearchive.org/" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a> and COMBINE Archive Web <a href="https://cat.bio.informatik.uni-rostock.de/" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a>.

      runBioSimulations uses the BioSimulators collection of simulation tools. These tools each support different modeling frameworks, different simulation algorithms, and different model formats. The BioSimulators website <a href="https://biosimulators.org/simulators"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a> outlines the modeling frameworks, simulation algorithms, and model formats supported by each tool. After determining the framework and format of your model and the simulation algorithm which you would like to execute, use this website to identify a simulation tool which is capable of executing your modeling project.

      <p>Please follow these steps to execute a modeling project:</p>

      <ol class="vertically-spaced">
        <li>Open the <a [routerLink]="['/run']">project submission form</a>.</li>
        <li>Select a COMBINE/OMEX file to execute.</li>
        <li>Select a simulation tool and a specific version of that tool.</li>
        <li>Enter a name for your project. We recommend choosing a descriptive name that will help you recall the purpose of your project. These names will be particularly helpful if you run multiple projects.</li>
        <li>Optionally, enter your email address to receive notification when your project has completed and is ready for your analysis.</li>
