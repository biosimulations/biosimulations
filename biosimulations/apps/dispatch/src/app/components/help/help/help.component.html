        runBioSimulations requires modeling projects (one or more simulations of one or more models) to be described by an OMEX file and packaged into a COMBINE archive. Please follow these steps to create OMEX and COMBINE files. Alternatively, COMBINE/OMEX files which describe modeling projects can be obtained from the BioSimulations repository of modeling projects <a href="https://biosimulations.org" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a>.

        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Create one or more models:</b>
          Create files which describe the models that you would like to simulate and save these files to the directory for the modeling project. Currently, runBioSimulations supports the BioNetGen Language <a href="https://bionetgen.org" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a> (BNGL) and Systems Biology Markup Language <a href="http://sbml.org" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a> (SBML) formats. More information about BNGL and SBML is available from their websites. Alternatively, models can be obtained from BioModels <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a>, BioSimulations <a href="https://biosimulations.org" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a>, and other model repositories.

        <li>
          <b>Create or more simulations:</b>
          Create a Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language <a href="https://sed-ml.org" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a> (SED-ML) file which describes the simulations that you would like to execute and the simulation results that you would like to record. Save these files to the directory for the modeling project. More information about SED-ML is available from the SED-ML website. Alternatively, simulations can be obtained from the BioSimulations repository of modeling projects <a href="https://biosimulations.org" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a>.

        <li>
          <b>Create an OMEX file which describes your model and simulation files and package them into a COMBINE archive file:</b>
          OMEX is a format for describing a collection of modeling files, and a COMBINE archive is a zip file which contains an OMEX file and all of the other files which comprise the modeling project. Several example COMBINE archives are available in the BioSimulators test suite <a href="Biosimulators_test_suite" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a>. More information about the OMEX and COMBINE formats is available at the COMBINE website <a href="https://combinearchive.org/" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a>. The COMBINE website lists several software tools for creating COMBINE archives including COMBINE Archive <a href="https://combinearchive.org/" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a> and COMBINE Archive Web <a href="https://cat.bio.informatik.uni-rostock.de/" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a>.

      runBioSimulations uses the BioSimulators collection of simulation tools. These tools each support different modeling frameworks, different simulation algorithms, and different model formats. The BioSimulators website <a href="https://biosimulators.org/simulators"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a> outlines the modeling frameworks, simulation algorithms, and model formats supported by each tool. After determining the framework and format of your model and the simulation algorithm which you would like to execute, use this website to identify a simulation tool which is capable of executing your modeling project.

      <p>Please follow these steps to execute a modeling project:</p>

      <ol class="vertically-spaced">
        <li>Open the project submission form <a [routerLink]="['/run']"><biosimulations-icon icon="internalLink"></biosimulations-icon></a>.</li>
        <li>Select a COMBINE/OMEX file to execute.</li>
        <li>Select a simulation tool and a specific version of that tool.</li>
        <li>Enter a name for your project. We recommend choosing a descriptive name that will help you recall the purpose of your project. These names will be particularly helpful if you run multiple projects.</li>
        <li>Optionally, enter your email address to receive notification when your project has completed and is ready for your analysis.</li>
        <li>Click the "Run" button. After you click the "Run" button, you will receive a URL where you will be able to view the status of your project and retrieve and visualize its results. If you provided an email address, you will receive email notification when your project has completed. This email will contain the same URL.</li>
        <li>Your simulation and its results will be available for six months.</li>
