  version: "0.1"
  description: |-
    Endpoints for working with models (e.g., [CellML](http://cellml.org/), [SBML](http://sbml.org/)), simulation experiments (e.g., [Simulation Experiment Description Language (SED-ML)](http://sed-ml.org/)), metadata ([OMEX Metadata](https://sys-bio.github.io/libOmexMeta/)), and simulation projects ([COMBINE/OMEX archives](https://combinearchive.org/)).

    Note, this API may change significantly in the future.

        Validate a COMBINE archive and the simulation experiments (SED-ML files) and models (e.g., SBML files) inside it.

        Notes:
        * An OMEX Manifest file is required to validate OMEX Metadata files. As a result, the `validateOmexManifest=false` option should often also be used with the `validateOmexMetadata=false` option.
        * Currently, submission to BioSimulations requires metadata to be in RDF-XML format.
        * COMBINE/OMEX archives must pass all validation checks for publication to BioSimulations.

        Notes
        * Thumbnails described in OMEX Metadata files cannot be validated without the source images. As a result, such metadata files must be validated as part of the validation of COMBINE/OMEX archives (`/combine/validate`) which include the thumbnail files.
        * Currently, submission to BioSimulations requires metadata to be in RDF-XML format.
